# EasyFinetuning
This repository contains the code for easy finetuning model for downstream NLP tasks. The aim is to put in an ordered and compact format the code that I use for finetune models, making simpler and hackable the model design and training process.

## Structure
- `classification`: contains the code for classification finetuning using ðŸ¤— API with a easy customable models and parallel training.

## TO DO
- [ ] improve the design
